# listtodo

## Quick info.
A small script to read the content of a file scanning for ToDo's or FixMe cases. Although better extension exist there are situations where you can't install extension. This script solves the problem by running without any outside dependencies. Apart from Notepad++ which might require to plugins.

This same approach can be adjusted to scan log files for example.

The script language choose is powershell as it's availabel on most, if not all, windows devices or servers and due to the restrictions in Pharma/CRO the idea was to keep this as slim as possible.

There are two methods that this was tested on.
1) VSCodium
2) Notepad++
